How does this contribute to our daily lives, what does it bring to the table of Nation Building?\n\nThere are now members of the British Government who are throwing around the term and describing Post Brexit Britain as \u201cBritish Empire 2.0\u201d.

That is the only thing we mean to Britain.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Nations was created so Britain could package and store its unwanted colonies for later use, in case of emergency break glass. The Commonwealth of Nations, was a grand idea until multicultural, multiracial Mud coloured people of the Commonwealth turned up at British ports and started walking up and down the British high streets like they own the place. It was then that the Commonwealth had to go, it was River of Blood time and as such the Commonwealth of Nations was The First Brexit.\n\nNow imagine my shock and horror when during the whole Brexit debate various pro-leave campaigners, far right leaders and racist Neo-Nazis, xenophobic hate mongers started throw about the idea that Britain still have its Multicultural and Multiracial Commonwealth to fall back on and do trade with. Just what is the Commonwealth to you? Something that you put aside for a rainy day, just in case your dream of a White European Empire Failed? And now they are throwing around the term of British Empire 2.0. To the members of the Commonwealth When are we going to start telling these damn people to go to hell!
