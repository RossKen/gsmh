Xxxxx\nPOWER versus FORCE\n\nExtract from Power versus Force By David R Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nOn examination, we\u2019ll see that power arises from meaning. It has to do with motive, and it has to do with principle. Power is always associated with that which supports the significance of life itself. It appeals to that part of human nature that we call noble \u2013 in contrast to force, which appeals to that which we call crass. Power appeals to what uplifts, dignifies and ennobles. Force must always be justified, whereas power requires no justification. Force is associated with the partial, power with the whole.\n\nIf we analyze the nature of force, it becomes readily apparent why it must always succumb to power; this is in accordance with one of the basic laws of physics. Because force always creates a counter-force, its effect is limited by definition. We could say that force is a movement \u2013 it goes from here to there (or tries to) against opposition. Power, on the other hand, is still. It\u2019s like a standing field that doesn\u2019t move. Gravity itself, for instance, doesn\u2019t move against anything. Its power moves all objects within its field, but the gravity field itself does not move.\n\nForce always moves against something, whereas power doesn\u2019t move against anything at all. Force is incomplete and therefore has to be fed energy constantly. Power is total and complete in itself and requires nothing from outside. It makes no demands; it has no needs. Because force has an insatiable appetite, it constantly consumes. Power, in contrast, energizes, gives forth, supplies, and supports. Power gives life and energy \u2013 force takes these away. We notice that power is associated with compassion and makes us feel positively about ourselves. Force is associated with judgment and makes us feel poorly about ourselves.\n\nForce always creates counter-force; its effect is to polarize rather than unify. Polarization always implies conflict; its cost therefore is always high. Because force incites polarization, it inevitably produces a win/lose dichotomy; and because somebody always loses, enemies are created. Constantly faced with enemies, force requires constant defence. Defensiveness is invariably costly, whether in the marketplace, politics, or international affairs.\n\nIn looking for the source of power, we\u2019ve noted that it\u2019s associated with meaning, and this meaning has to do with the significance of life itself. Force is concrete, literal and arguable. It requires proof and support. The sources of power, however, are inarguable and aren\u2019t subject to proof. The self-evident isn\u2019t arguable. That health is more important than disease. That life is more important than death, that honour is preferable to dishonour, that faith and trust are preferable to doubt and cynicism, that the constructive is preferable to the destructive \u2013 all are self-evident statements not subject to proof. Ultimately, the only thing we can say about a source of power is that it just \u201cis\u201d.\n\nEvery civilization is characterized by native principles. If the principles of a civilization are noble, it succeeds; if they\u2019re selfish, it falls. As a term, principles may sound abstract, but the consequences of principle are quite concrete. If we examine principles, we\u2019ll see that they reside in an invisible realm within consciousness itself. Although we can point out examples of honesty in the world, honesty itself as an organizing principle central to civilization does not independently exist anywhere in the external world. True power, then, emanates from consciousness itself; what we see is a visible manifestation of the invisible.", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 8, "parent_id": "164305410295882_2129505040442566", "type": "root", "likes": [{"id": "1899183653656916", "name": "David McMurdo"}, {"id": "10211500363197345", "name": "Michal Patulski"}, {"id": "446194185740123", "name": "Janet Kelly"}, {"id": "10155587940479828", "name": "Jocelyn Patterson"}, {"id": "1540601425971248", "name": "Jeffrey Rogalski"}, {"id": "1959066804336325", "name": "Deborah Peters"}, {"id": "10154723546340994", "name": "Gita Pink"}, {"id": "10212383189670142", "name": "Keith Pottinger"}]}, {"id": "2129505040442566_2129553890437681", "created_time": "2017-03-29T08:05:57+0000", "from": {"name": "Sue Lewis", "id": "10211321511766609"}, "message": "POWER versus FORCE\n\nExtract from Power versus Force By David R Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nOn examination, we\u2019ll see that power arises from meaning.
