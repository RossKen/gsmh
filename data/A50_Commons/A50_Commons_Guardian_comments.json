We would expect someone earning \u00a3200k pa to pay more tax than someone earning \u00a320k wouldn't we?\n\n\"add that to the trade deficit...\"\n\nAgain, this is only valuable for comparison when we think in terms of GDP.  Our exports to the EU account for 13% of our total GDP, whereas the EU's exports to us, accounts for only 3% of theirs.\n\n\"the \u00a3 has dropped which has increased exports which is good...\"\n\nThe negative impact on imports has dwarfed the positive impact on exports.\n\nThis is mostly because we manufacture relatively little.  Of the goods that we do manufacture, they make up only 20% of our total GDP, and they tend to fall in to one of two categories:\n\n1. High valued, luxury goods, that are largely inelastic, and therefore not too susceptible to gains from a devalued currency.\n\n2. Low priced goods, made with imported raw materials.\n\nWe can see this in the latest PMI's.  The increased cost of imports is negating, and overwhelming any benefit to exports.\n\n\"and since joining the EU in 1973 we've paid over \u00a3500 billion in membership...\"\n\nSince the referendum last year, the BofE has spent \u00a3450 billion in terms of quantitative easing, just in order to increase liquidity to manage volatility and help prevent an initial recession.\n\nLet's think for a second about what we have 'gained' over that same time frame.\n\nPrior to joining the what was then the EEC, we were in complete economic turmoil, had riots in the streets, and were requiring constant bail outs from the IMF. We were known laughably as the 'sick dog' of Europe.\n\nBy the late 1960s, France, West Germany and Italy, the three founder members closest in size to us, produced more per person than we did and the gap was growing larger every year. Between 1958, when the EEC was set up, and our entry in 1973, GDP per head rose 95% in these three countries compared with only 50% here.\n\nAfter becoming an EEC member, we slowly began to catch up. GDP per person has grown faster than Italy, Germany and France in the 42 years since. By 2013, we became more prosperous than the average of the three other large European economies for the first time since 1965, and we moved from the being the 8th largest economy in the world, to the 5th. (We are back to 7th now due to Sterling crashing but that's another story altogether)\n\n\"In the same time the UK government borrowing has increased to \u00a31.5 trillion...\"\n\nAbsolutely, it's disastrous.  But the blame for this lies in extremely poor fiscal policy since 2010.  Prior to the coalition government, the national debt was around \u00a3800 billion.  It has more than doubled since then:\n\nhttps://fullfact.org/economy/has-uks-debt-doubled/\n\nI won't get into the reasons why as this is already an extremely long comment, but let's just say that family economics, and the notion of 'tightening our belts' does not translate well on an international scale.  Simply put, austerity has been a disaster.\n\n\"I don't think we are in a bad bargaining position...\"\n\nI disagree. As I mentioned previously, our exports to the EU account for 13% of our total GDP, whereas the EU's exports to us, accounts for only 3% of theirs.  They can therefore absorb any potential loss, far more easily than we can.  But the greater issue now is the loss of single market membership and the inevitable consequences of leaving a market with which our economy has been quite literally built to exploit, with 80% of our GDP coming from services.\n\nThe loss of financial passporting rights is just the start...

Any suggestion of us leaving the single market, was referred to as scaremongering, and was palmed off as 'project-fear'.\n\nHere's a few examples:\n\n\"Only a madman would actually leave the market\" - Owen Paterson, Vote Leave campaigner\n\n\"Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market\" - Daniel Hannan, Vote Leave campaigner\n\n\"There's a free trade zone from Iceland to the Russian border and Britain will still be part of it after we vote leave.\" - Chris Grayling, Brexit campaigner and current member of Theresa May's cabinet\n\n\"There is no question about it, Britain will still have access to the single market after we vote leave\" - Matthew Elliot, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign\n\n\"Britain will stay in the single market whatever happens\" - Pete North, pro-Brexit blogger\n\n\"Increasingly, the Norway option looks the best for the UK\" - Arron Banks, Leave.EU founder and massive UKIP bankroller\n\n\"Wouldn\u2019t it be terrible if we were really like Norway and Switzerland? Really? They\u2019re rich. They\u2019re happy. They\u2019re self-governing\" - Nigel Farage, Leave.EU campaigner and UKIP leader at the time\n\nNorway, Switzerland, all of these countries have complete free trade with the EU, and by the way, I can't help noticing that they're doing pretty well.\" - Daniel Hannan, Vote Leave campaigner\n\nAnyway, this referendum will be historically viewed as an absolutely travesty of democracy.\n\nA representative democracy, complete with balances and checks, a free press and the supremacy of law, is the 'least' dangerous form of government we know.\n\nHowever, direct democracy is hugely dangerous. In fact, famously so. Incidentally, this is the very reason that we have a representative democracy in the first place. Just ask the Ancient Greeks how continually asking the populace to make decisions that are easily manipulated by self serving politicians worked out for them.\n\nReferendums have throughout history been the favourite tools of dictators like Hitler and Mussolini for an extremely good reason. Simply put, they are frighteningly easy to manipulate through populism and outright lies. And ultimately end up with a tiny snapshot in time of public opinion, on what is deceivingly portrayed as binary subject.\n\nOur referendum was no exception.\n\nThe leave campaign promised several different and completely incompatible versions of Brexit to the electorate and packaged them all up into a single 'leave' vote, regardless of the fact that only one version could ever be achieved. This is why in most referendums, the bar is set at >65% in order to effect constitutional change.\n\nIf the outcome truly reflected what people voted for we would likely have something similar to the following:\n\nRemain - 48%\nSoft Brexit - 36%\nHard Brexit - 16%\n\nWe are now in the position of only fulfilling the desire and political will of the smallest portion of voters. And therein lies the fundamentally undemocratic nature of binary referendums.
