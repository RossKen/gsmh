Not one vote cast in SCOTLAND has ever mattered! Because of the Westminster numbers, whatever government England votes for, the UK gets. So we have no democracy here!!! 4 decades of tory rule that we voted against is proof enough, and our defiance was punished by the closure of all the mines; closure of all the steelworks; closure of all the shipyards losing hundreds if thousands of jobs. The term used by Westminster's Thatcher when these industries needed some assistance was \"let the markets decide\". Funny how when the greedy bankers collapsed everywhere they were bailed out to the tune of over a trillion pounds of our money... Not a mention of \"let the markets decide\".\n\nFACTS:\nFact: Scotland has an oil boom waiting to happen on the West Coast, but Michael Hesaltine signed a cessation of any form of oil exploration in the entire area in the 80's to make way for nuclear submarines which Scotland doesn't want!\n\nFact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out a out the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high. (Ok for the Clyde though)\n\nFact: Scotland, with only 1 Tory MP, was forced to take the shocking attack on the poor & disabled called The Bedroom Tax, even though as our nations government, Holyrood voted to utterly reject this awful tax on the poor. Westminster gave us it anyway!\n\nFact: We are led to believe that the oil in our waters is finished and its a dying industry. Yet 13.5 billion has been invested by oil companies in the last 2 years alone!\n\nFact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day!\n\nFact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they'd be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they'd have us believe?\n\nFact: Westminster has amassed over \u00a31.3 trillion debt and still growing at nearly \u00a36000 a second. Thats another \u00a3516 million today alone which YOU will have to pay for.\n\nFact: Of the 178 countries that have gained their own independence across this planet, not one single one of them has ever asked to reverse this independence ! https://m.youtube.com/?reload=7&rdm=26kiwf4mz#/watch?v=JlebrzWw8vg", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 0, "parent_id": "164665060214766_1665103080173215", "type": "root", "likes": []}, {"id": "1665103080173215_1665157540167769", "created_time": "2017-03-13T12:58:14+0000", "from": {"name": "Iain Taylor", "id": "10212729256881746"}, "message": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "parent_id": "1665103080173215_1665145166835673", "type": "reply", "likes": []}, {"id": "1665103080173215_1665201190163404", "created_time": "2017-03-13T13:43:43+0000", "from": {"name": "David Ofosu-Appiah", "id": "1358911737509881"}, "message": "#Brexit destroying the #UK", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "parent_id": "164665060214766_1665103080173215", "type": "root", "likes": []}]
